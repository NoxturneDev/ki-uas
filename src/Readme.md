1. Project Goal & Vision

Goal: To create a centralized, simple-to-use web application for tracking and managing essential information about Formula 1 teams, their drivers, and their cars on a season-by-season basis.

Vision: The application will serve as a foundational "single source of truth" for a user's F1 team data. While starting simple, it's designed with a logical structure that could be expanded in the future to include race results, component tracking, or financial data. The primary user is an administrator or team manager who needs to quickly view and manage team-related information.
2. User Flow

The user's journey through the application will be straightforward and focused on efficient data management.

    Login: The user authenticates into the system (handled by Laravel Filament).

    Dashboard/Homepage: Upon logging in, the user is presented with a dashboard. This page will show a high-level overview, such as a list of current teams.

    Navigate to Teams: The user selects a "Teams" section from the navigation menu.

    View & Manage Teams:

        The user sees a list of all registered teams (e.g., Ferrari, Mercedes, Red Bull).

        From this list, they can Create a new team, Edit an existing team's details (like name or base location), or Delete a team.

    View Team Details:

        Clicking on a specific team takes the user to that team's detail page.

        This page will display the team's information and show lists of associated drivers and cars for the current season.

    Navigate to Drivers/Cars: From the main navigation or the team detail page, the user can access the "Drivers" or "Cars" sections to perform similar CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for those entities.

    Manage Seasons: The user can manage "Seasons" (e.g., 2024 Season, 2025 Season) to associate teams, drivers, and cars with a specific year of competition.

3. Data Models (The Core Entities)

We will limit the system to four primary models to maintain simplicity while ensuring the data is relational and meaningful.
a. Team

This model represents a Formula 1 constructor.

    id (Primary Key, Auto-increment)

    name (String, e.g., "Scuderia Ferrari")

    base_location (String, e.g., "Maranello, Italy")

    team_principal (String, e.g., "Frédéric Vasseur")

    chassis_name (String, e.g., "SF-24")

    power_unit (String, e.g., "Ferrari")

    created_at (Timestamp)

    updated_at (Timestamp)

b. Driver

This model represents a driver. A driver is associated with a team for a specific season.

    id (Primary Key, Auto-increment)

    name (String, e.g., "Charles Leclerc")

    nationality (String, e.g., "Monegasque")

    date_of_birth (Date)

    driver_number (Integer, e.g., 16)

    created_at (Timestamp)

    updated_at (Timestamp)

c. Car

This model represents the physical car. For simplicity, we'll tie a car to a driver and a season.

    id (Primary Key, Auto-increment)

    nickname (String, Optional, e.g., "Lucilla")

    serial_number (String, Unique, e.g., "CH-2024-01")

    status (Enum/String, e.g., 'Active', 'Retired', 'Crashed')

    created_at (Timestamp)

    updated_at (Timestamp)

d. Season

This model acts as the central pivot to connect everything for a given year. It holds the relationships.

    id (Primary Key, Auto-increment)

    year (Integer, Unique, e.g., 2024)

    team_id (Foreign Key to teams.id)

    driver_id (Foreign Key to drivers.id)

    car_id (Foreign Key to cars.id)

    created_at (Timestamp)

    updated_at (Timestamp)

Explanation of Relationships:

    Team to Season (One-to-Many): One Team can participate in many Seasons.

    Driver to Season (One-to-Many): One Driver can be associated with many Seasons (e.g., driving for the same or different teams across years).

    Car to Season (One-to-One): One Car is uniquely associated with one entry in the Seasons table. This simplifies tracking, meaning Car "CH-2024-01" is tied to a specific driver in a specific team for that year.

    The Seasons Table: This is our pivot table. An entry in this table represents a specific driver, in a specific car, for a specific team, during a specific year. For example, a row could represent: "In 2024, Charles Leclerc (Driver) drove Car #1 for Scuderia Ferrari (Team)."

This structure provides a robust yet simple foundation for your Laravel Filament application.
